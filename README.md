### Hey there! 👾

My name is Taj Loodu, and I'm a recent software engineering graduate from the University of Ottawa with a knack for full-stack, DevOps, and product engineering. I have previous experience as a developer at PSPC, Ford, RBC, and CIRA, and I'm currently looking for new graduate opportunities 👨‍💻.

I love to keep busy and am currently working with Go, Flutter and TypeScript with goals to dive into RedwoodJS and Elixir soon. Feel free to take a look at my [resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12r1cxrC6XW648F_SzVO_vjPLFj5aBuDB/view?usp=sharing) to see what else I have worked with.

I'm always looking to connect and meet new people. Feel free to follow me, email me, or send me a connection request on LinkedIn — all found in the sidebar 😄.
